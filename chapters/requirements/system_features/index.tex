                    & & .Trigger: & The User will trigger the capture when he or she decides the realtime preview is optimal. \\

                    & & .Response: & The App must be able to capture a still image from the camera when the User pushed the capture button. The image will be saved in a standard image format on the phone’s file system. \\

                    & & .Display: & The App will present the image to the user on the device’s screen. \\

        \subsubsection{Extract the Border of a Skin Lesion}

            \paragraph{Description}

            In oder to be able to properly analyse the skin lesion image, the MDApp must be able to distinguish pixels that belong to the lesion from pixels that belong to the healthy skin area surrounding the lesion.

        \subsubsection{Calculate the Risk Assessment Skin Lesion}

            \paragraph{Description}

            The MDApp sends the skin lesion image and border data as a request to the Risk Assessment Service.

        \subsubsection{Create, Modify, and Delete Metadata}

            \paragraph{Description}

            The Smartphone User can add metadata to a captured image. This can include the location on the body that the image was captured from, date of capture, and a text description. This metadata can be associated with an image so that it can be used at a later data for comparison and review.
