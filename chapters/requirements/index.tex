This chapter will describe the requirements of the application as a whole. The structure of this chapter follows the SRS Template as proposed by Wiegers in Chapter 11 and Appendix D of \cite{wiegers2013software}.

\section{Vision and Scope}

    This section describes the high levels goal of the Melanoma Detection App as well as to define boundaries that limit what can be expected of the App.

    \subsection{Business Case}

        A smart phone based assistant would provide a valuable service by making it easy, painless, inexpensive, and fast to get a preliminary risk assessment of a skin lesion. It is too easy to postpone making an appointment with a dermatologist to have a suspect lesion examined. Visiting a dermatologist is not on most peopleâ€™s list of fun things to do, it requires time and effort. By the time a lesion is visually compelling enough, it might be too late.

A smart phone based application that could make a preliminary diagnosis in near realtime would be a great time save and offer compelling enough information to actually make the appointment with a dermatologist.

    \subsection{Scope and Limitations}

    This chapter describes which features are part of the scope of the Melanoma Detection Application, what can be expected of it, and what are it's limitations.

    \subsubsection{Major Features}
        \noindent
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item[]  \textbf{FE-1} : The smart phone app allows the user to capture and analyse an image of a skin lesion and provide a risk assessment to the user of the lesion being a malignant melanoma.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-2} : The app allows the user to create, view, edit or delete metadata that is associated with an image and corresponding risk assessment.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-3} : The app allows the user to save or archive the image and corresponding assessment for future comparison and review.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-4} : The user can browse archived images, assessments, and associated metadata.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-5} : The user can send a set of images with associated assessment and metadata via email.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-6} : The app will run on all popular smart phone devices and systems.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-7} : The analysis algorithms employed by the app should be easily updatable and extendable.
        \end{itemize}

            \label{fig:partial_feature_tree}
        \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Limitations and Exclusions}

        \noindent
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item[]  \textbf{LI-1} : The Melanoma Detection App will use visual indicators to calculate the risk of a lesion being a dangerour melanoma. Other types of skin cancer such as basal call carcinoma or squanous cell carcinoma have different characteristics making them less easy to visually detect. The Melanoma Detection App will not take any other types of skin cancer or skin conditions into acount when calculating the risk assessment for melanoma.
            \item[]  \textbf{LI-2} : Typical Smartphone camera's might not have the ability to capture images at close enough range needed to capture a skin lesion's details at high enough resolution. It might be necessary for the Smartphone User to additionaly purchase a readily available clip-on macro lens for smart phones.

        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Use Cases}

        10 Important Use Cases have been identified. The schema as defined in Chapter 8 and Appendix D of \cite{wiegers2013software} was used to capture the attributes of each Use Case. The Use Case UML diagram in figure \ref{fig:uml} illustrates the most important use cases. Tables \ref{fig:uc-1} to \ref{fig:uc-10} describe the use cases in detail.

\section{Software Requirements Specification}

    \subsection{Introduction}
        \subsubsection{Purpose}

            The Software Requirements Specification will describe the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the Melanoma Detection App. It is meant to be a guideline for developers who will be implementing the mobile application.

    \subsection{Overall Description}
        \input{chapters/requirements/overall_description/index}

    \subsection{System Features}
        \input{chapters/requirements/system_features/index}

    \subsection{Data Requirements}
    \input{chapters/requirements/data_requirements/index}

    \subsection{External Interface Requirements}
        \input{chapters/requirements/external_interfaces/index}

    \subsection{Quality Attributes}

        This section lists and describes the non-functional requirements.

        \subsubsection{External Quality Attributes}

                    \item[PRI-1 :] No information about the user shall be transmitted to any external services with the exception of when the user sends the image and metadata via email.
                \end{itemize}

                    \item[INT-2 :] Data and state shall be persisted, so that when reopened, the MDApp will have the same state as when it was last closed.
                    \item[INT-3 :] Data and state shall be persisted, so that no data is lost when the MDApp is updated.
                \end{itemize}

            \paragraph{Useability}
