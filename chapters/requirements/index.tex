This chapter will describe the requirements of the application as a whole. The structure of this chapter follows the SRS Template as proposed by Wiegers in Chapter 11 and Appendix D of \cite{wiegers2013software}.

\section{Vision and Scope}

    This section describes the high levels goal of the Melanoma Detection App and



    \subsection{Business Case}

        A smart phone based assistant would provide a valuable service by making it easy, painless, inexpensive, and fast to get a preliminary risk assessment of a skin lesion. It is too easy to postpone making an appointment with a dermatologist to have a suspect lesion examined. Visiting a dermatologist is not on most peopleâ€™s list of fun things to do, it requires time and effort. By the time a lesion is visually compelling enough, it might be too late.

A smart phone based application that could make a preliminary diagnosis in near realtime would be a great time save and offer compelling enough information to actually make the appointment with a dermatologist.

    \subsection{Scope and Limitations}
    \subsubsection{Major Features}
        \noindent
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item[]  \textbf{FE-1} : The smart phone app allows the user to capture and analyse an image of a skin lesion and provide a risk assessment to the user of the lesion being a malignant melanoma.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-2} : The app allows the user to create, view, edit or delete metadata that is associated with an image and corresponding risk assessment.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-3} : The app allows the user to save or archive the image and corresponding assessment for future comparison and review.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-4} : The user can browse archived images, assessments, and associated metadata.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-5} : The user can send a set of images with associated assessment and metadata via email.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-6} : The app will run on all popular smart phone devices and systems.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-7} : The analysis algorithms employed by the app should be easily updatable and extendable.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Limitations and Exclusions}

        \noindent
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item[]  \textbf{LI-1} : The Melanoma Detection App will use visual indicators to calculate the risk of a lesion being a dangerour melanoma. Other types of skin cancer such as basal call carcinoma or squanous cell carcinoma have different characteristics making them less easy to visually detect. The Melanoma Detection App will not take any other types of skin cancer or skin conditions into acount when calculating the risk assessment for melanoma.

    \subsection{Introduction}
        \subsubsection{Purpose}

            The Software Requirements Specification will describe the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the Melanoma Detection App. It is meant to be a guideline for developers who will be implementing the mobile application.
