This chapter will describe the requirements of the application as a whole. The structure of this chapter roughly follows the SRS Template as proposed by Wiegers in Chapter 11 and Appendix D of \cite{wiegers2013software}.

\section{Vision and Scope}

    \subsection{Background}

        Melanoma is a type malignant skin tumour that develops from benign melanocytic nevi. Although less frequent than other skin cancer types, it causes more deaths \cite{cancer_gov_skin}, and it’s incidence is increasing dramatically, especially in the young white population \cite{S_ez_2013}. Early diagnosis and treatment is vital.

Several non-invasive techniques exist which dermatologist can employ to visually make a diagnosis. The most common are pattern analysis, the ABCD rule, the 7-point checklist and the Menzies method, among others \cite{marghoob2004atlas}. These methods generally use a combination of defined visual clues and indicators to assess the risk of a skin lesion. CAD ( Computer Aided Diagnosis ) systems exists that can assist a dermatologist, and even provide automatic diagnosis with an accuracy comparable to that of doctors trained in dermoscopic techniques \cite{Filho2015}.

    \subsection{Business Case}

        A smart phone based assistant would provide a valuable service by making it easy, painless, inexpensive, and fast to get a preliminary risk assessment of a skin lesion. It is too easy to postpone making an appointment with a dermatologist to have a suspect lesion examined. Visiting an dermatologist is not on most people’s list of fun things to do in the spare time, it requires time and effort. By the time a lesion is visually compelling enough, it might be too late.

A smart phone based application that could make a preliminary diagnosis in near real time would be a great time save and offer compelling enough information to actually make the appointment with a dermatologist.

    \subsection{Scope and Limitations}
    \subsubsection{Major Features}
        \noindent
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item[]  \textbf{FE-1} : The smart phone app allows the user to capture and analyse an image of a skin lesion and provide a risk assessment to the user of the lesion being a malignant melanoma.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-2} : The app allows the user to create, view, edit or delete metadata that is associated with an image and corresponding risk assessment.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-3} : The app allows the user to save or archive the image and corresponding assessment for future comparison and review.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-4} : The user can browse archived images, assessments, and associated metadata.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-5} : The user can send a set of images with associated assessment and metadata via email.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-6} : The app will run on all popular smart phone devices and systems.

            \item[] \textbf{FE-7} : The analysis algorithms employed by the app should be easily updatable and extendable.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Introduction}
        \subsubsection{Purpose}

            The Software Requirements Specification will describe the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the Melanoma Detection App. It is meant to be a guideline for developers who will be implementing the mobile application.
