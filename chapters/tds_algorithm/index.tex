\section{Description of the Algorithm}

Early detection of melanoma greatly increases the chances of successful treatment. A biopsy can be performed in order to gain a definitive diagnosis. However, biopsies are invasive, painful and take time. There are also visual markers Dermatologists look for in order to make a risk Assessment. The ABCD Rule, also known as Stokes or TDS Calculation, looks for 4 sets of features. Based on the features the Total Dermatoscopic Score \(TDS\) is calculated.

\section{Calculation of ABCD Values}
\subsection{Asymmetry}
\subsection{Border}
\subsection{Color}
\subsection{Differential}

\section{Two Examples}
\subsection{Postitiv Example}

\subsection{False Example}

ABCD Values were calculated but classification result was false.
