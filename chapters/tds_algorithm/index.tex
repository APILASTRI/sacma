\section{Description of the Algorithm}

Early detection of melanoma greatly increases the chances of successful treatment. A biopsy can be performed in order to gain a definitive diagnosis. However, biopsies are invasive, painful and take time. There are also visual markers Dermatologists look for in order to make a risk Assessment. The ABCD Rule, also known as Stokes or TDS Calculation, looks for 4 sets of features. Based on the features the Total Dermatoscopic Score (TDS) is calculated.

The 4 sets of features are Asymmetry (A), Border Irregularity (B), Color (C) and Differential Structure or Diameter (D).

Asymmetry can have a value of 0, 1 or 2 depending on the symmetry of the lesion. Where 0 is symmetric and 2 is asymmetric. A value of 1 indicates at least one axis was found across which symmetry exists. The Border score is an integer value from 0 to 8 indicating the presence of border irregularities in 8 regions. Color is an integer value from 1 to 6 indicating the presence of one to six specific colors. Similarly, the value for D indicates the presence of one to five distinct structures or textures. Alternatively, in some literature\cite{Siddiq_2015} D is defined as Diameter, where a diameter greater than 6mm results in a value of 5, otherwise 1.

The final TDS Score is the weighted sum of the ABCD Values.

\begin{equation}
TDS = A * 1.3 + B * 0.1 + C * 0.5 + D * 0.5
\end{equation}
