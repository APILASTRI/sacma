In order to capture the formal use cases we will use a schema based on the one defined in Requirement Engineering Fundamentals \cite{9781937538774}.


\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ | >{\bfseries}l | p{8.35cm} |}
    \hline
    ID &  Unique designation of the use case \\ \hline
    Name & Unique name of the use case \\ \hline
    Priority & Importance of the use case according to applied prioritization technique \\ \hline
    Description &  Use case in user story form\\ \hline
    Dependencies & dependencies \\ \hline
    Trigger event & Name of the event that triggers this use case \\ \hline
    Actors & List of all the actors involved in this use case \\ \hline
    Preconditions & List of all necessary constraints that must be met before this use case can begin execution \\ \hline
    Posconditions & List of all states the system can be in immediately after the execution of the main scenario  \\ \hline
    Result & Description of the results that are produced during the use case execution \\ \hline
    Main scenario & Sequnce of events that occur during the use case. \\ \hline
    Alternate scenarios & Alternative sequence of events that might occur. \\ \hline

    Comments & Other infos \\ \hline
